## Introduction

Welcome to **Module 6** of ECON 700.

This module extends probability theory to the study of continuous random variables and their probability distributions. Students begin by differentiating discrete from continuous variables and exploring the concept of a probability density function (PDF) as the continuous counterpart to the probability mass function (PMF). The module introduces three key continuous distributions—the uniform, normal, and exponential—each representing a different type of process.

The module emphasizes the normal distribution as the cornerstone of statistical analysis due to its relationship with the Central Limit Theorem. Through practical applications, students use R to compute probabilities (dnorm, pnorm, and qnorm), visualize areas under the curve, and identify key percentiles and standard deviations. The module concludes with the exponential distribution as a model of waiting times in Poisson processes, illustrating the connection between continuous distributions and real-world timing or reliability problems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

-   **Differentiate** between discrete and continuous random variables and describe the role of probability density functions.

-   **Compute** and interpret probabilities using the uniform, normal, and exponential distributions.

-   **Apply** R functions (dnorm, pnorm, qnorm, dunif, punif, pexp) to calculate and visualize probability densities and cumulative distributions.

-   **Explain** the properties of the normal distribution and its connection to the Central Limit Theorem.

-   **Calculate** expected values, variances, and probabilities for continuous random variables.

-   **Evaluate** real-world examples that demonstrate how continuous distributions model random events such as arrival times, measurement variation, and economic outcomes.
