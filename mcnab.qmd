## Contact Policy

Students should feel welcome to contact me via email at [rmcnab\@odu.edu](mailto:rmcnab@odu.edu){.email} or drop by Zoom office hours. I strongly encourage students to communicate with me. I will try to answer emails within 48 business hours (often much sooner) for course related topics.

Students should take the time to craft complete, professional emails. The more information that you can provide about a question or problem, the more likely that my response will be helpful. Avoid non-professional language and practice communicating in the corporate workplace. Emails that are unprofessional will be returned with no action.

Students should proactively address issues with the class and scheduling rather than waiting until an assignment or case study discussion is overdue. In many cases, accommodations can be made for ‘life events,’ however, clear and prompt communication is necessary.

## Virtual Office Hours

Office hours will be held on a rotating schedule and are available by appointment. Check the class announcements for the schedule of office hours, which vary to accommodate students with different schedules.
