## Introduction

Welcome to **Module 7** of ECON 700.

This module introduces the concepts of sampling and sampling distributions, emphasizing how samples drawn from populations form the basis for statistical inference. Students begin by exploring different sampling methods and learn how sampling variability arises. The module demonstrates that while each sample may differ, the sampling distribution of the sample mean or proportion has predictable properties that enable estimation of population parameters. Learners use simulations and R-based visualizations to see how the shape and spread of sampling distributions change with sample size and variability in the population.

Building on these concepts, the module introduces the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and its foundational role in inferential statistics. Students discover how, regardless of the population distribution, the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution as sample size increases. The module applies these principles to compute the standard error, evaluate probabilities for sample means and proportions, and interpret results within real-world economic and data-driven contexts. By the end, students understand how sampling distributions link descriptive statistics to inferential conclusions about populations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

-   MLO 1: **Explain** the purpose and importance of sampling in statistical inference.

-   MLO 2: **Differentiate** among simple random, stratified, and cluster sampling techniques

-   MLO 3: **Describe** how sampling variability affects sample statistics and their relationship to population parameters.

-   MLO 4: **Apply** the Central Limit Theorem to explain the behavior of sampling distributions for means and proportions.

-   MLO 5: **Calculate** and interpret the standard error of sample means and proportions.

-   MLO 6: **Use** R to simulate and visualize sampling distributions and assess how sample size influences variability and normality.
