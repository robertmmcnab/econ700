## Introduction

Welcome to **Module 8** of ECON 700.

This final module integrates the principles of statistical inference, emphasizing how sample evidence supports or refutes claims about population parameters. Students learn how to formulate and test hypotheses regarding population means, proportions, and variances. The module introduces the logic of null and alternative hypotheses, Type I and Type II errors, and the role of significance levels (α) in decision-making. Through practical examples and R-based visualizations, learners explore one-tailed and two-tailed tests using both the z and t distributions, building a strong understanding of how to determine rejection regions, calculate p-values, and interpret statistical significance.

The module extends these concepts to inferences involving two populations and variability. Students conduct hypothesis tests for the difference between two means and proportions and explore the chi-square $\chi^2$ and F-distributions for analyzing population variances. By connecting hypothesis testing to real-world economic and data-driven applications, students gain experience in applying inference to managerial decisions and policy evaluation. This capstone module consolidates key statistical methods, preparing students to interpret and evaluate empirical evidence in research and professional contexts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

-   MLO 1: **Formulate** null and alternative hypotheses and explain the logic of statistical decision-making. (CLO 1, 2, 3, 4)

-   MLO 2: **Differentiate** between Type I and Type II errors and interpret the role of significance levels in hypothesis testing. (CLO 1, 2, 3, 4)

-   MLO 3: **Conduct** hypothesis tests for population means and proportions using the z and t distributions in R. (CLO 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

-   MLO 4: **Apply** hypothesis testing to compare two population means or proportions and interpret p-values and confidence levels. (CLO 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

-   MLO 5: **Evaluate** population variances using the chi-square and F-distributions to test assumptions about variability. (CLO 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

-   MLO 6: **Integrate** hypothesis testing results into real-world economic and data analysis contexts to draw valid inferential conclusions. (CLO 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
