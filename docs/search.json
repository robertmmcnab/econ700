    "text": "4.1 Data and the Challenge of Economic Analysis\nWe are awash in data. The challenge is to find the right data at the appropriate time to investigate an empirical question of interest. In some cases, the data are well defined, consistently formatted, readily available, and structured to facilitate analysis. Then there are data that could help answer a question, but are not in an easily accessible format. But, before tackling these problems, we need to ask the simple question:\nWhat are data?\nThe Merriam-Webster dictionary defines data as: “…factual information (such as measurements or statistics) used a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation.” Broadly speaking, data can consist of measurements regarding the health of individuals, performance of firms, the income of regions, the inflation rate of a national economy, among other things. Data can also consist of statistics that describe the properties of an underlying set of measurements.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) defines the civilian labor force as “The labor force includes all people age 16 and older who are classified as either employed and unemployed. Conceptually, the labor force level is the number of people who are either working or actively looking for work.”\nHow many people are the in the civilian labor force in the United States? How many in Virginia? Is the labor force larger today than it was at the same time last year? How does the growth in the labor force in Virginia compare to other states? All these questions require obtaining data and, for some, manipulating data to create statistics about the properties of the data.",

In other words, the elements are the states on which data are collected and presented in the table. There are six variables in the table: the symbol of the variable from FRED, the date of the observation, the value of the observation, the value of the observation in decimal form, and the geography name of the observation.\nThe table contains different scales of measurement. The date variable contains information on time while the state variable is measured on the nominal scale. The nominal scale is used to identify the observational data, that is, the data in the table are organized by the geographical area of the observation. The data pertaining to the unemployment rate is ordinal data in that the measurements contain numeric information.\nBroadly speaking, data can be classified as categorical or quantitative. In the table, the variable containing the geographical names is categorical. We cannot mathematically manipulate the categorical data (subtracting 1 from Virginia does not produce a meaningful result). We could, however, create a new variable that contains numerical values to represent the categorical data, that is, the new quantitative variable would be a numerical representation of the categorical data.",

In this context, individuals can represent people, firms, airlines, cars, or some other characteristic that defines the unique observations.\nFor example, if we had data on the average fuel mileage of passenger vehicles in 2019, then individuals would refer to each type of passenger vehicle. If we had randomized data on 100,000 taxpayers in Virginia for 2018, then individuals would refer to unique taxpayers. Lastly, if we collected data on airplane arrivals at Dulles International Airport for each day in 2019, then we would have individual observations across time. We could organize this data by plane registration, airline, or country of origin, or some other category of interest.\nCross-sectional data are data collected across individuals at the same point of time. There is no depth to cross-sectional data, that is, the data represent a snapshot at a specific point in time.\nTime series data are data collected over several time periods. Data for the headline unemployment graph for the United States are time series data.In this context, time series data refers to one variable across time. One can have a collection of time series variables (inflation rate, unemployment rate, and so on). Time series data has depth but not breadth.\nPanel data are data collected across individuals and time. If we collected data for the unemployment rate across states from 2013 to 2025, then we would have individuals (states) and time (months) as defining characteristics of our data. Panel data has breadth (across individuals) and depth (across time).",

If we had access to student records, this might be a relatively easy exercise. In other words, if we had access to data for the population of students, we could calculate the average age of the student population.\nNow, let’s assume we wanted to calculate the average age for all college students in the United States. The problem has become more difficult. We could try and obtain all the records from all the colleges and universities in the United States but this effort might be costly and complex.\nWe could instead sample different colleges and universities and construct an estimate of the average age of college students. The “closer” our sample is to the population, the better our estimate of the average age of all the college students in the United States. If we only selected colleges and universities with undergraduate programs, our sample would likely understate the average age of college students. If we only selected graduate programs at colleges and universities, our sample would likely overstate the average age of college students.\nThe process by which we use a sample to estimate the properties of the population is statistical inference.\nGathering a sample that is representative of the population is the first step. We then must understand the properties of the sample and how this reflects the properties of the population.",

    "text": "5.1 Why use R and RStudio?\nWe will use R and RStudio extensively in this class. You will also use these programs extensively in the following classes on the econometrics sequence.\nA frequently asked question is “why can’t we use Excel?”\nThe simple answer is that Excel is good for some things but R is better for the things we want to do in this and other classes.\nWriting code (programming) allows for:\nOther programs have lower fixed costs than R. These programs, whether Excel, SAS, SPSS, or TSP, have ‘built in’ functions and interfaces that allow ‘easier entry’ than R. In other words, you will invest less time to learn how to start working in other programs than R.\nSo, why then use R? First, coding is like learning a second language. It takes a while to learn the logic and ‘flow’ of the programming language. Second, unlike many other programs, you have a very good idea of what R is doing. If you write code, you learn where data come from, how they are formatted, the properties of data, and you gain a much deeper understanding of the process by which you arrive at an answer.\nAnother strength of this approach is that once you learn to code in R and use RStudio, your marginal cost of learning Python, C++, or SQL is lower because the logic behind each of these languages is similar.\nSimply put, coding is as much about the journey as the destination.",

If something doesn’t work, look for small typos.\nYou can then start asking other resources for help.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is helpful to debug code. It can even write code for you, if you know what you are doing.\nRemember, however, that AI is only as good as its algorithm and your prompt. It can (and will) give you answers that are incorrect, answers that appear correct but are wrong, or lead you through solution paths that are inefficient.\nCoding is a dance between what you know and what you can find.

    "text": "6.2 Assigning Character Values to a Variable\nWe can assign character values to a variable. In the following code, we assign the name “Timothy” as a character to the variable .\nThere is a subtle but important difference to storing a value as a character or as a numeric variable.\nWe assign the or value 06250 to and 06250 as a or value to .\nNote what happens: when stored as a numeric value, 06250 is stored as 6250. When 06250 is stored as “06250” as a character variable, the character variable does not “lose” then “0” in the front of “06250”.\nThis can be very important if you are storing an identification value with a leading 0.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

Note that we tell the package that the format of the date is year-month-day (ymd).\nLikewise, we assign 09-05-2020 to date2 as a date variable but tell the package that the format of the date is now month-day-year (mdy).\nNote that even though the dates are in different formats, the lubridate package transforms the dates into a format recognizable by R.\nHaving transformed the date values, we can calculate the time difference by assigning the difference between the two dates to variable date3.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "text": "6.4 Creating Vectors\nWe can now create a vector that contains several values. In the following example, we combine several numbers and assign them to the variable x5.\nWe can transpose the variable x5. Notice the difference between x5 and its transpose. X5, when output to a table, has five rows and one column. The transpose of X5, when it output to a table, is one row and five columns.\nWe can also combine other variables (if they are the same type) to form a new vector. You can combine single element variables with vectors to create a new vector x6.\nWe can also combine vectors. We create x7 by combining the variables x1, x2, x3, x4 with the vector x5.\n\nrm(list = ls())\n\n#Load packages\n\nlibrary(kableExtra, quiet = TRUE)\n\n# Assign values to x1, x2, x3, x4\n\nx1 &lt;- 1\nx2 &lt;- -5\nx3 &lt;- 136\nx4 &lt;- 0.47\n\n#Create a vector \n\nx5 &lt;- c(12, 13, 14, 25, 100)\n\n#Transpose x5\n\nx6 &lt;- t(x5)\n\n#Use existing variables to create a row vector\n\nx7 &lt;- c(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)\n\n# Use kable To Create Tables of X5 and X6\n# align = 'c' -&gt; aligns to center\n# digits = 0  -&gt; no decimals\n# col.names -&gt; sets a name for the column\n\nkable(x5,\n      align = 'c',\n      digits = 0,\n      col.names = c('X5'),\n      caption = 'Table Containing Variable X5')\n\nkable(x6,\n      align = 'c',\n      col.names = c('A','B','C','D','E'),\n      caption = 'Table Containing Transpose of X5')\n\nkable(x7,\n      align = 'c',\n      digits = 0,\n      col.names = c('X7'),\n      caption = 'Table Containing Variable X7')\n\n\nTable Containing Variable X5\n\n\nX5\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n13\n\n\n14\n\n\n25\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\nTable Containing Transpose of X5\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\n\n\n\n\n12\n13\n14\n25\n100\n\n\n\n\nTable Containing Variable X7\n\n\nX7\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n-5\n\n\n136\n\n\n0\n\n\n12\n\n\n13\n\n\n14\n\n\n25\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we display x5, for example, we note is a vector 5 elements.
