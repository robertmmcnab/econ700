I will try to answer emails within 48 business hours (often much sooner) for course related topics.\nStudents should take the time to craft complete, professional emails. The more information that you can provide about a question or problem, the more likely that my response will be helpful. Avoid non-professional language and practice communicating in the corporate workplace. Emails that are unprofessional will be returned with no action.\nStudents should proactively address issues with the class and scheduling rather than waiting until an assignment or case study discussion is overdue. In many cases, accommodations can be made for ‘life events,’ however, clear and prompt communication is necessary.",

    "text": "5.1 Data and the Challenge of Economic Analysis\nWe are awash in data. The challenge is to find the right data at the appropriate time to investigate an empirical question of interest. In some cases, the data are well defined, consistently formatted, readily available, and structured to facilitate analysis. Then there are data that could help answer a question, but are not in an easily accessible format. But, before tackling these problems, we need to ask the simple question:\nWhat are data?\nThe Merriam-Webster dictionary defines data as: “…factual information (such as measurements or statistics) used a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation.” Broadly speaking, data can consist of measurements regarding the health of individuals, performance of firms, the income of regions, the inflation rate of a national economy, among other things. Data can also consist of statistics that describe the properties of an underlying set of measurements.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) defines the civilian labor force as “The labor force includes all people age 16 and older who are classified as either employed and unemployed. Conceptually, the labor force level is the number of people who are either working or actively looking for work.”\nHow many people are in the civilian labor force in the United States? How many in Virginia? Is the labor force larger today than it was at the same time last year? How does the growth in the labor force in Virginia compare to other states? All these questions require obtaining data and, for some, manipulating data to create statistics about the properties of the data.",

There are five variables in the table: the symbol of the variable from FRED, the date of the observation, the value of the observation, the value of the observation in decimal form, and the geography name of the observation.\nThe table contains different scales of measurement. The date variable contains information on time while the state variable is measured on the nominal scale. The nominal scale is used to identify the observational data, that is, the data in the table are organized by the geographical area of the observation. The data pertaining to the unemployment rate is ratio data in that the measurements contain numeric information.\nBroadly speaking, data can be classified as categorical or quantitative. In the table, the variable containing the geographical names is categorical. We cannot mathematically manipulate the categorical data (subtracting 1 from Virginia does not produce a meaningful result). We could, however, create a new variable that contains numerical values to represent the categorical data, that is, the new quantitative variable would be a numerical representation of the categorical data.",

In this context, individuals can represent people, firms, airlines, cars, or some other characteristic that defines the unique observations.\nFor example, if we had data on the average fuel mileage of passenger vehicles in 2019, then individuals would refer to each type of passenger vehicle. If we had randomized data on 100,000 taxpayers in Virginia for 2018, then individuals would refer to unique taxpayers. Lastly, if we collected data on airplane arrivals at Dulles International Airport for each day in 2019, then we would have individual observations across time. We could organize this data by plane registration, airline, or country of origin, or some other category of interest.\nCross-sectional data are data collected across individuals at the same point of time. There is no depth to cross-sectional data, that is, the data represent a snapshot at a specific point in time.\nTime series data are data collected over several time periods. Data for the headline unemployment graph for the United States are time series data. In this context, time series data refers to one variable across time. One can have a collection of time series variables (inflation rate, unemployment rate, and so on). Time series data has depth but not breadth.\nPanel data are data collected across individuals and time. If we collected data for the unemployment rate across states from 2013 to 2025, then we would have individuals (states) and time (months) as defining characteristics of our data. Panel data has breadth (across individuals) and depth (across time).",

If we had access to student records, this might be a relatively easy exercise. In other words, if we had access to data for the population of students, we could calculate the average age of the student population.\nNow, let’s assume we wanted to calculate the average age for all college students in the United States. The problem has become more difficult. We could try and obtain all the records from all the colleges and universities in the United States but this effort might be costly and complex.\nWe could instead sample different colleges and universities and construct an estimate of the average age of college students. The “closer” our sample is to the population, the better our estimate of the average age of all the college students in the United States. If we only selected colleges and universities with undergraduate programs, our sample would likely understate the average age of college students. If we only selected graduate programs at colleges and universities, our sample would likely overstate the average age of college students.\nThe process by which we use a sample to estimate the properties of the population is statistical inference.",

These programs, whether Excel, SAS, SPSS, or TSP, have ‘built in’ functions and interfaces that allow ‘easier entry’ than R. In other words, you will invest less time to learn how to start working in other programs than R.\nSo, why then use R? First, coding is like learning a second language. It takes a while to learn the logic and ‘flow’ of the programming language. Second, unlike many other programs, you have a very good idea of what R is doing. If you write code, you learn where data come from, how they are formatted, the properties of data, and you gain a much deeper understanding of the process by which you arrive at an answer.\nAnother strength of this approach is that once you learn to code in R and use RStudio, your marginal cost of learning Python, C++, or SQL is lower because the logic behind each of these languages is similar.\nSimply put, coding is as much about the journey as the destination.",

    "text": "6.8 Packages in R\nOne of the most powerful features of R is that there are numerous packages or add-ons to base R that provide additional functionality. We need to install these packages and then include them so they are accessible to R as we work with data.\nIf you need to install a package, you can always use the install.packages command. For example, you could use install.packages(“dplyr”) to install the dplyr package.\nOnce a package is installed, you typically will not need to re-install it. You may need to update your packages, however, and this can be easily done. You can either use the function update.packages or update packages through the packages menu in RStudio.\nIn the following code, we clear the workspace (essentially erasing working memory) and load three packages.\nFirst, we clear memory with the command rm(list = ls()).\nSecond, we load the packages into memory by using the library statement.\nFor example, library(dplyr) loads the dplyr package so we can use its functions later in our code. Note, that if you have not installed the dplyr package, the code will not run.\nTo learn more about each package, see the following links.\ndplyr: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/\nggplot2: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2.html\nlubridate: https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/\ntidyverse: https://www.tidyverse.org/\nkable: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra\n\n#Clear the Workspace\n\nrm(list = ls())\n\n#Load packages\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\nTo do this in RStudio, first install the above packages and then use the following steps\n\nOpen RStudio\nSelect File | New File | R Script\nCopy the code above and paste it into your script file\nClick on “Run” or Use CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Rstudio with package code",

Matrices can contain quantitative and qualitative elements.\nA matrix is a table or a two-dimensional array-like structure. In R, a data frame is a list of variables with the same number of rows with unique row names. If we use the dplyr package, a tibble is similar to a data frame.\nA data frame can have one column with numeric elements, another with date elements, another with character elements, and so on.\nIn the webR code chunk below, we create two vectors, x8 and x9.\nWe can bind these vectors together, that is, ‘merge’ the two vectors. How we choose to put the vectors together is important.\nThere are two functions at our disposal: rbind and cbind.\nThe rbind function “stacks” the observations in the vectors.\nThe cbind function “adds” the column of the second vector to the first vector, creating a data frame with two columns.",

    "text": "8.6 Manipulating the Dataframe and Adding New Variables\nStarting with the cardata data frame, we can now utilize one of the features of the packages to pipe the data.\nPiping means that the data ‘flows’ in the direction of the pipe. It’s actually called a pipeline of data.\nA bit of housekeeping. We want to convert the rownames in cardata to a variable.\nWe pipe the data frame and then use the function rownames_to_column() to do just that. We then pipe the data to rename the new variable rowname to car.\nWe can now use the mutate function to create a new variable or replace an existing variable.\nIn the following code, the data flow from cardata to the next line of code to create a new variable km_per_gallon using the mutate function.\nImagine a temporary data frame that consists of cardata with a new column for the km_per_gallon variable.\nEach new line of within the mutate function creates a new variable. The second variable that we create converts kilometers per gallon to kilometers per liter or km_per_liter.\nYour temporary data frame now consists of the cardata data frame plus the two new variables.\nThe third line of the mutate statement creates a new variable that converts miles per gallon into kilometers per liter, essentially duplicating the process of the first two lines of the mutate statement. The new variable is called km2_per_liter.\nAt this point, you decide you only need to keep a subset of variables.\nWe pipe the resulting data frame to the select statement. The variables included in the select statement are kept in the temporary data frame while the variables excluded from the select statement are deleted from the temporary data frame.\nYou have now reached the end of the pipe.

In effect, an API allows us to “grab” data from an external source. If the external source updates the data, then our next API call with obtain the updated data.\nFor example, let’s say we wanted to obtain data from FRED on real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the United States from 1980 to the most current data available. We could go to FRED, search for real GDP, find the real GDP variable is called GDPC1, and download the data into an Excel file. This process is labor-intensive and subject to error.\nFRED: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/\nReal GDP: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1\nWe can use an API call to obtain the data. Instead of having to write the code for an API call, we can use a package called tidyquant.\nWe have the variable name GDPC1 and so we can simply use the tq_get function in tidyquant to retrieve the real GDP series.\nWe rename the price variable to rgdp and we convert the date using the lubridate package.\nWe can use the head or kable to print out the contents of the first rows of the resulting data frame.\nWe see the data are organized such that each row corresponds to a time period, that is, the first row represents real GDP for the 1st quarter of 1950, the second row represents real GDP for the 2nd quarter of 1950, and so on.\n\nrm(list = ls())\n\n#Load packages\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(tidyquant)\n\n#Use tq_get to obtain real GDP from FRED\n\nrgdp &lt;- tq_get(\"GDPC1\",\n                    get  = \"economic.data\",\n                    from = \"1950-01-01\" ) %&gt;%\n        rename(rgdp = price) %&gt;%\n        mutate(date = lubridate::ymd(date))\n\nkable(rgdp[1:5,]) %&gt;%\n  kable_classic()\n\n\n\n\nsymbol\ndate\nrgdp\n\n\n\n\nGDPC1\n1950-01-01\n2346.104\n\n\nGDPC1\n1950-04-01\n2417.682\n\n\nGDPC1\n1950-07-01\n2511.127\n\n\nGDPC1\n1950-10-01\n2559.214\n\n\nGDPC1\n1951-01-01\n2593.967",

    "text": "8.9 The FRED API for Nominal and Real GDP\nIn the previous examples, we made an API call for one variable at a time. The result was two data frames, one for nominal GDP, and one for real GDP. It would be more efficient to make one API call that results in a single data frame with both variables.\nIn the following code, we combine the names of the two variables, that is, c(“GDP”,“GDPC1”) creates a row vector with the two names. This row vector is used by the tq_get function to make an API call to obtain the two variables from FRED.\nWhat’s important to note is that the all_gdp data fame is in long format. In other words, each row corresponds to one period of time for one variable.\nWe have to do some housecleaning. When we obtain the data from FRED, the variable names are contained in a variable called symbol and the values are contained in a variable named price. We rename those to variable and value, respectively.\nWe then plot the data using the ggplot2 package.\nThe ggplot function is very flexible and you can modify almost every element of a graph.

    "text": "15.1 Introduction\nWelcome to Module 3 of ECON 700.\nThis module introduces students to bivariate data analysis through the concepts of covariance and correlation. Building on prior discussions of univariate statistics, it explores how two variables move together and the extent to which their relationship can be quantified. Covariance is presented as a measure of joint variability that indicates whether two variables tend to increase or decrease together. Students learn that while the sign of covariance conveys direction (positive or negative association), its magnitude is difficult to interpret due to dependence on the units of measurement.\nTo overcome this limitation, the module introduces the Pearson correlation coefficient—a standardized, unitless measure that captures the strength and direction of linear relationships between two variables. Through practical examples using R and real-world data such as mtcars and World Bank indicators, students compute, interpret, and compare covariance and correlation values. The module concludes by emphasizing that correlation measures association, not causation, and that careful interpretation is required when evaluating statistical relationships.",

Are the data “clustered” around the measure of central tendency?\nSkewness measures the asymmetry of a probability distribution of a real-valued random variable around its mean. Skewness can be positive, negative, or undefined.\nFor a distribution with a single peak, a negative skew implies that the tail is on the left side of the distribution. A positive skew implies that the tail is on the right side of the distribution. A zero skew implies that the tails ‘balance’ which may mean the distribution is symmetric.\nThe Fisher-Pearson standardized moment coefficient is used by R and other major statistical software packages to measure skewness in a univariate sample. The sample skewness measure is equal to:\n\\[G_1 = \\frac{n}{(n-1)(n-2)}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\Big( \\frac{x_i - \\bar{x}}{s} \\Big)^3\\]",

The negative skew means that the tail of the left side of the distribution is longer than the tail on the right side of the distribution.\nIn other words, if skewness is negative, the mass of the distribution is concentrated to the right, that is, the left tail is longer.\nThe third vector, z has a mean of 7.214 and a median of 7.0.

Moving from univariate to bivariate analysis starts with a discussion of measures of association between two variables.\nTo start our discussion, we need to understand the expectations operator.",

    "text": "18.2 The Expectations Operator\nGiven a function \\(f(x)\\) in the variable \\(x\\), the expectation value is denoted as \\(E[X]\\).\nFor a single, discrete variable \\(X\\) with probability density function \\(P(X)\\), the expectation of \\(X\\) is defined as:\n\\[\nE[X] = \\sum_{X} f(x) P(x)\n\\]\nIf \\(X\\) is a continuous variable, then \\(E[X]\\) is defined as:\n\\[\nE[X] = \\int f(x) P(X) dx\n\\]\nThe expected value of a random variable is the arithmetic mean of that variable. This term has been retained in mathematical statistics to mean the long-run average for any random variable over an indefinite number of trials or samples. In other words,\n\\[\nE[X] = \\mu_x\n\\]\nThe variance of a random variable \\(X\\) is defined as the expected (average) squared deviation of the values of this random variable about their mean. That is,\n\\[var(x) = E[(X - \\mu)^2] = E[X^2] - \\mu^2 = \\sigma_X^2\\]\nThe expectations operator adheres to the following rules.\nLet \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) be random variables and let \\(k\\) and \\(j\\) be constants.\nThe first rule is that the expectation of a constant is a constant.\nIn other words, if \\(k=4\\), then every observation of \\(k\\) is 4 and the mean of \\(k\\) is \\(E[k] = \\mu_k = 4\\).\n\\[\nE[k] = k\n\\]\nThe second rule is that the expectation of the product of a constant and a random variable is equal to the product of a constant and the expectation of a random variable. In other words, assume that we multiply every observation of a random variable by 3 and then find the long-run mean of the random variable. This is the same as finding the long-run mean and multiplying the mean by 3.\n\\[\nE[kX] = kE[X] = k \\mu_x\n\\]\nThe third rule is that the expectation of the sum of two random variables is equal to the addition of the expectiations of the two random variables. In other words, if we add two random variables, one with the mean of 5 and the other with the mean of 10, this is the same as adding the two means together.\n\\[\nE[X+Y] = E[X] + E[Y]\n\\]\nThe fourth rule combines the second and third rules in that if you have the sum of the two random variables where each random variable is multiplied by a constant, then you can restate this as the product of the constant and the expectation of the first random variable plus the product of the constant and the expectation of the second random variable.\n\\[\nE[kX + jY] = kE[X] + jE[Y]\n\\]\nThere are a number of other expectation rules which we will cover later on in the course.",

Observational studies may fall victim to confounding variables, leading one to conclude causation exists. For example, assume that 100 patients were sick with a disease with 5% mortality after two weeks. All the patients were given an experimental drug and at the end of two weeks, only 1 patient has died. Obviously the drug has reduced mortality, or has it? What if 10,000 patients were treated and only 1% died?\nWhile the drug is associated with decreased mortality, we have not controlled for other potential confounding variables. The general health of the patients may have been different than the general population. The patients may have received other drugs that are known to reduce mortality. The age of the patients may be lower (higher) than the general population. This is why scientists use double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials to examine the efficacy of new drugs. These trials reduce (but do not eliminate) the possibility of confounding so investigators can examine whether the outcomes of the control (receive placebo) and treatment (receive drug) groups are statistically different.\nA strong association between two variables is suggestive of a causal relationship but we must be cautious. How were the data gathered? Was there a mechanism to reduce the presence of confounding variables? Are the data experimental, that is, random assignment into control and treatment groups? As we move from observational studies to experimental studies, the ability to suggest that association implies causation increases, but, in the end, we must find other methods to explore whether two (or more) variables are causally related.",

    "text": "19.1 Introduction\nWelcome to Module 4 of ECON 700.\nThis module introduces the foundational concepts of probability as a measure of uncertainty and likelihood. Students learn how random experiments generate outcomes that form a sample space, and how probability quantifies the chance that specific outcomes occur. The module progresses through the building blocks of probability theory, including combinations, permutations, complements, unions, and intersections of events. Through these principles, students develop an understanding of mutually exclusive and independent events and how they shape probability calculations.\nThe second half of the module applies probability rules to real-world decision-making and data analysis. Learners explore conditional probability, the multiplication and addition laws, and the distinction between joint and marginal probabilities. The module culminates in an introduction to Bayes’ Theorem, illustrating how prior beliefs are updated with new evidence—first conceptually, then through applications like medical testing and the Monty Hall problem. This approach emphasizes the interpretive and practical power of probability in economic reasoning, uncertainty, and risk assessment.",

Assuming that no flips end up on the edge, the likelihood of heads for a fair coin is 0.50 while the likelihood of tails is 0.50.\nProbability is a numerical measure of the likelihood of an outcome and is bounded between 0 and 1, including 0 and 1. If the probability of an outcome is ‘close’ to zero, then it is less likely to occur than an outcome that is ‘closer’ to 1.\nIn other words, if the outcome of the outcome is beneficial (winning a prize), we would prefer that the probability of the outcome be higher (closer to 1) than lower. Likewise, if the outcome of the outcome if not beneficial (incurring a costly bill), we would prefer the probability of the outcome be lower (closer to 0) than higher.",

    "text": "20.2 Experiments and Randomness\nA random experiment is a process that generates outcomes.\nIn our coin flipping example, the process of flipping the coin generates two possible outcomes, heads or tails. The outcomes are well defined prior to the start of the experiment and the outcomes are mutually exclusive. In other words, an outcome must be either heads or tails and there is not a possible outcome where heads and tails occur simultaneously.\nEach repetition of the experiment is a trial.\nAn experiment may consist of one trial, several trials, or many trials. However many trials there are in an experiment, the outcome of each trial is a random event, that is, the outcome is not pre-determined and occurs by chance.\nConsider an unfair six-sided die that is weighted so that it lands on six on every throw. Throwing the die is not a random experiment because the outcome of every trial is known prior to the experiment. Regardless of whether you throw the die one time or fifty times, the outcome is always six. Now compare this to a fair six sided die. On any given trial, the die could land on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The outcome of any specific trial is unknown prior to its occurrence but, over repeated trials, we know the probability of each outcome.\nWe have now discussed two random experiments, the flipping of a fair coin and the toss of a fair six sided tie. In the case of the fair coin, we have identified two possible outcomes: heads and tails. In the case of the fair six sided die, we have identified six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\nThe set of possible outcomes for each random experiment is known as the sample space.\nThe sample space consists of the mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive outcomes of a random experiment.\nMutually exclusive implies that a random experiment cannot have the same outcome simultaneously.\nCollectively exhaustive implies that all the outcomes of the random experiment are contained in the sample space.",

Determining the number of outcomes in a sample space can quickly become tedious, or, as complexity increases, hard. We can, however, rely on two counting rules to assist us in determining the number of outcomes in a sample space. The difference between the two counting rules is whether the order of the outcomes matters.\nA combination examines the number of ways the objects can be selected, without regard to the order in which they are selected.\nA bowl of vegetable soup contains a different vegetables and the number of vegetables may differ by type. We don’t care about ordering since all the vegetables together make soup.\nAssume we have four objects (A,B,C,D), and we select one object at a time without replacement and draw all the objects.\nLet’s list the possible combinations:\n\nABCD\n\nWhy is there only one combination?

Think about throwing a fair six-sided die two times. A roll of 1 on the first throw and 2 on the second throw is different than a roll of 2 on the first roll and 1 on the second roll.

Likewise, we would assign a probability of 67.6% to patients having a mild reaction to the drug, and so on.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "text": "23.1 Introduction\nWelcome to Module 5 of ECON 700.\nThis module introduces students to the foundational concepts of probability and their application in data-driven analysis. Students begin by exploring the difference between discrete and continuous random variables, followed by the construction and interpretation of probability distributions. Using examples such as coin tosses, dice rolls, and manufacturing outcomes, the module develops an understanding of how randomness, expected value, and variance describe uncertainty and predict long-run behavior. Students will also examine empirical probability distributions using simulated and real-world data in R.\nBuilding on these principles, the module introduces the binomial and Poisson distributions—two key models for analyzing the likelihood of events within defined conditions. Learners use R to calculate and visualize probability mass functions, cumulative distribution functions, and inverse functions, as well as to simulate random variables. By the end of the module, students will understand how probability distributions underpin inferential statistics and decision-making in economics and data analysis.",

Assume this is a relatively small airport and that you are observing the checkpoint mid-day.\nThe probability of observing 1 passenger is likely close to 1. The probability of observing 100 passengers is likely less than 1. The probability of observing 1,000 passengers is likely close to 0. The probability of observing 10,000 passengers is likely very close to 0.",

    "text": "27.1 Introduction\nWelcome to Module 6 of ECON 700.\nThis module extends probability theory to the study of continuous random variables and their probability distributions. Students begin by differentiating discrete from continuous variables and exploring the concept of a probability density function (PDF) as the continuous counterpart to the probability mass function (PMF). The module introduces three key continuous distributions—the uniform, normal, and exponential—each representing a different type of process.\nThe module emphasizes the normal distribution as the cornerstone of statistical analysis due to its relationship with the Central Limit Theorem. Through practical applications, students use R to compute probabilities (dnorm, pnorm, and qnorm), visualize areas under the curve, and identify key percentiles and standard deviations. The module concludes with the exponential distribution as a model of waiting times in Poisson processes, illustrating the connection between continuous distributions and real-world timing or reliability problems.",

    "text": "31.1 Introduction\nWelcome to Module 7 of ECON 700.\nThis module introduces the concepts of sampling and sampling distributions, emphasizing how samples drawn from populations form the basis for statistical inference. Students begin by exploring different sampling methods and learn how sampling variability arises. The module demonstrates that while each sample may differ, the sampling distribution of the sample mean or proportion has predictable properties that enable estimation of population parameters. Learners use simulations and R-based visualizations to see how the shape and spread of sampling distributions change with sample size and variability in the population.\nBuilding on these concepts, the module introduces the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and its foundational role in inferential statistics. Students discover how, regardless of the population distribution, the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution as sample size increases. The module applies these principles to compute the standard error, evaluate probabilities for sample means and proportions, and interpret results within real-world economic and data-driven contexts. By the end, students understand how sampling distributions link descriptive statistics to inferential conclusions about populations.",

Our samples are relatively ‘large’ so the variance of the sample averages is much lower than the variance of the random variable.\nFor example, what is the probability, with a sample size of 3,600, sample average of 52,500, and a sample standard error of 45.83 of drawing a sample with a sample average less than or equal to 52,400?\n\\[\nP(\\bar{x} \\le 52,400) = P(Z \\le \\frac{52400-52500}{45.83}) = 0.0145\n\\]\nLet’s say that we change the sample size from 3,600 to 600. What impact does this have on the probability of observing a sample average of 52,400 or less?\nGiven the change in the sample size, we re-estimate the standard error and obtain a new probability of observing a sample with a sample average of 52,400.\n\\[\nse(\\bar{x}) = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{2,750}{\\sqrt{600}} = 112.27\n\\]\n\\[\nP(\\bar{x} \\le 52,400) = P(Z \\le \\frac{52400-52500}{112.27}) = 0.1865\n\\]\nIn the code chunk below, we create simulated population of 500,000 observations and then take samples of 60, 600, and 6000 from the population. We then estimate the probability of observing a sample average of 52,400 for each of the sample sizes.\nAs one would expect, given the Central Limit Theorem, as you increase the sample size, the standard error of the sample average estimator declines, and the probability of observing a sample with an average income of 52,400 declines.\n\nrm(list = ls())\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\npopulation &lt;- tibble(income = rnorm(500000, 52500, 2750))\n\nsample_1 &lt;- population %&gt;% \n            slice_sample(n = 3600, replace = FALSE) %&gt;%\n            summarize(average = mean(income),\n                      sd      = sd(income),\n                      se      = sd(income)/sqrt(6000)) %&gt;%\n            mutate(p_x_bar = pnorm(52400, 52500, se),\n                   n       = 6000) %&gt;%\n            select(n, everything())\n\nsample_2 &lt;- population %&gt;% \n            slice_sample(n = 600, replace = FALSE) %&gt;%\n            summarize(average = mean(income),\n                      sd      = sd(income),\n                      se      = sd(income)/sqrt(600)) %&gt;%\n            mutate(p_x_bar = pnorm(52400, 52500, se),\n                   n       = 600) %&gt;%\n            select(n, everything())\n\nsample_3 &lt;- population %&gt;% \n            slice_sample(n = 60, replace = FALSE) %&gt;%\n            summarize(average = mean(income),\n                      sd      = sd(income),\n                      se      = sd(income)/sqrt(60)) %&gt;%\n            mutate(p_x_bar = pnorm(52400, 52500, se),\n                   n       = 60) %&gt;%\n            select(n, everything())\n\noutput &lt;- sample_1 %&gt;%\n          rbind(sample_2) %&gt;%\n          rbind(sample_3) %&gt;%\n          arrange(n)\n\nkable(output,\n      align = 'c',\n      digits = 3,\n      col.names = c('n', 'X-bar', 'SD(X)', 'SE(X-bar)','P(X-bar &lt;= 52400)')) %&gt;%\nkable_classic()\n\n\n\n\nn\nX-bar\nSD(X)\nSE(X-bar)\nP(X-bar &lt;= 52400)\n\n\n\n\n60\n52657.51\n2804.182\n362.018\n0.391\n\n\n600\n52676.70\n2841.645\n116.010\n0.194\n\n\n6000\n52440.07\n2763.601\n35.678\n0.003",

In other words, we define the level of statistical significance as the likelihood of a false positive.\nFor example, assume that we are investigating whether a drug statistically reduces the likelihood of cancer. The null hypothesis is that the drug has not statistically discernible influence on the likelihood of cancer (or increases the likelihood of having cancer).\nThe alternative hypothesis is that the drug reduces the likelihood of having cancer.\nA false positive would be determining the drug reduces the likelihood of having cancer when it has no impact (or, even worse, increases the likelihood of having cancer).\nSo, if we set the level statistical significance to 0.05, we are saying there is a 5% change of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis.\nAn increase in the level of statistical significance lowers the probability of a Type 1 error.\nLet \\(\\alpha\\) be equal to the probability of making a Type 1 error.

Students learn how to formulate and test hypotheses regarding population means, proportions, and variances. The module introduces the logic of null and alternative hypotheses, Type I and Type II errors, and the role of significance levels (α) in decision-making. Through practical examples and R-based visualizations, learners explore one-tailed and two-tailed tests using both the z and t distributions, building a strong understanding of how to determine rejection regions, calculate p-values, and interpret statistical significance.\nThe module extends these concepts to inferences involving two populations and variability. Students conduct hypothesis tests for the difference between two means and proportions and explore the chi-square \\(\\chi^2\\) and F-distributions for analyzing population variances. By connecting hypothesis testing to real-world economic and data-driven applications, students gain experience in applying inference to managerial decisions and policy evaluation. This capstone module consolidates key statistical methods, preparing students to interpret and evaluate empirical evidence in research and professional contexts.",

The surgery is costly and invasive. As such, you want to only reject the null hypothesis of no impact with a high degree of confidence and so you set the significance level of the test to 1%.\nA significance level of 1% is “more stringent” than a significance level of 5% and this means you require more evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\nIn other words, by increasing the significance level to 1%, you reduce the likelihood of false positive but you also increase the likelihood of a false negative.\nThe graphic below highlights the trade off between Type I and Type II errors.\nAs you increase the level of significance, \\(\\alpha\\), you move the threshold of the test to the right, reducing the likelihood of a Type I error but increasing the likelihood of a Type II error.\nSince we are typically most concerned about a false positive, we focus on Type I errors rather than Type II errors, hence our focus on the level of statistical significance which is equal to the likelihood of making a Type I error.\n\nImage Source: http://grasshopper.com/blog/the-errors-of-ab-testing-your-conclusions-can-make-things-worse/",
