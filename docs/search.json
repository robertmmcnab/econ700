I will try to answer emails within 48 business hours (often much sooner) for course related topics.\nStudents should take the time to craft complete, professional emails. The more information that you can provide about a question or problem, the more likely that my response will be helpful. Avoid non-professional language and practice communicating in the corporate workplace. Emails that are unprofessional will be returned with no action.\nStudents should proactively address issues with the class and scheduling rather than waiting until an assignment or case study discussion is overdue. In many cases, accommodations can be made for ‘life events,’ however, clear and prompt communication is necessary.",

The second textbook (Irizarry) provides an introduction to data science methods using R and covers many of the same topics that we discuss in class. These textbooks are free.\nAs this course focuses on the learning and application of statistical techniques, a computer with R and R Studio installed is necessary. You will need access to a laptop, tablet, or other computing device to complete the assignments and and exams.\nYou may also use R Studio Cloud instead of a locally installed version of R.\nYou can create a free R-Studio cloud account at &lt;[https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/&gt;\nAll other course materials are on Canvas or can be accessed through Canvas. You are required to know how to use Canvas to access and submit assignments, quizzes, and examinations. You should also be comfortable using ODU email to communicate.",

    "text": "5.1 Data and the Challenge of Economic Analysis\nWe are awash in data. The challenge is to find the right data at the appropriate time to investigate an empirical question of interest. In some cases, the data are well defined, consistently formatted, readily available, and structured to facilitate analysis. Then there are data that could help answer a question, but are not in an easily accessible format. But, before tackling these problems, we need to ask the simple question:\nWhat are data?\nThe Merriam-Webster dictionary defines data as: “…factual information (such as measurements or statistics) used a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation.” Broadly speaking, data can consist of measurements regarding the health of individuals, performance of firms, the income of regions, the inflation rate of a national economy, among other things. Data can also consist of statistics that describe the properties of an underlying set of measurements.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) defines the civilian labor force as “The labor force includes all people age 16 and older who are classified as either employed and unemployed. Conceptually, the labor force level is the number of people who are either working or actively looking for work.”\nHow many people are the in the civilian labor force in the United States? How many in Virginia? Is the labor force larger today than it was at the same time last year? How does the growth in the labor force in Virginia compare to other states? All these questions require obtaining data and, for some, manipulating data to create statistics about the properties of the data.",

In the table, the variable containing the geographical names is categorical.

In this context, individuals can represent people, firms, airlines, cars, or some other characteristic that defines the unique observations.\nFor example, if we had data on the average fuel mileage of passenger vehicles in 2019, then individuals would refer to each type of passenger vehicle. If we had randomized data on 100,000 taxpayers in Virginia for 2018, then individuals would refer to unique taxpayers. Lastly, if we collected data on airplane arrivals at Dulles International Airport for each day in 2019, then we would have individual observations across time. We could organize this data by plane registration, airline, or country of origin, or some other category of interest.\nCross-sectional data are data collected across individuals at the same point of time. There is no depth to cross-sectional data, that is, the data represent a snapshot at a specific point in time.\nTime series data are data collected over several time periods. Data for the headline unemployment graph for the United States are time series data.In this context, time series data refers to one variable across time. One can have a collection of time series variables (inflation rate, unemployment rate, and so on). Time series data has depth but not breadth.\nPanel data are data collected across individuals and time. If we collected data for the unemployment rate across states from 2013 to 2025, then we would have individuals (states) and time (months) as defining characteristics of our data. Panel data has breadth (across individuals) and depth (across time).",

If we had access to student records, this might be a relatively easy exercise. In other words, if we had access to data for the population of students, we could calculate the average age of the student population.\nNow, let’s assume we wanted to calculate the average age for all college students in the United States. The problem has become more difficult. We could try and obtain all the records from all the colleges and universities in the United States but this effort might be costly and complex.\nWe could instead sample different colleges and universities and construct an estimate of the average age of college students. The “closer” our sample is to the population, the better our estimate of the average age of all the college students in the United States. If we only selected colleges and universities with undergraduate programs, our sample would likely understate the average age of college students. If we only selected graduate programs at colleges and universities, our sample would likely overstate the average age of college students.\nThe process by which we use a sample to estimate the properties of the population is statistical inference.",

You will also use these programs extensively in the following classes on the econometrics sequence.\nA frequently asked question is “why can’t we use Excel?”\nThe simple answer is that Excel is good for some things but R is better for the things we want to do in this and other classes.\nWriting code (programming) allows for:\nOther programs have lower fixed costs than R. These programs, whether Excel, SAS, SPSS, or TSP, have ‘built in’ functions and interfaces that allow ‘easier entry’ than R. In other words, you will invest less time to learn how to start working in other programs than R.\nSo, why then use R? First, coding is like learning a second language. It takes a while to learn the logic and ‘flow’ of the programming language. Second, unlike many other programs, you have a very good idea of what R is doing. If you write code, you learn where data come from, how they are formatted, the properties of data, and you gain a much deeper understanding of the process by which you arrive at an answer.\nAnother strength of this approach is that once you learn to code in R and use RStudio, your marginal cost of learning Python, C++, or SQL is lower because the logic behind each of these languages is similar.\nSimply put, coding is as much about the journey as the destination.",

Matrices can contain quantitative and qualitative elements.\nA matrix is a table or a two-dimensional array-like structure. In R, a data frame is a list of variables with the same number of rows with unique row names. If we use the dplyr package, a tibble is similar to a data frame.\nA data frame can have one column with numeric elements, another with date elements, another with character elements, and so on.\nIn the webR code chunk below, we create two vectors, x8 and x9.\nWe can bind these vectors together, that is, ‘merge’ the two vectors. How we choose to put the vectors together is important.\nThere are two functions at our disposal: rbind and cbind.\nThe rbind function “stacks” the observations in the vectors.\nThe cbind function “adds” the column of the second vector to the first vector, creating a data frame with two columns.",

    "text": "8.6 Manipulating the Dataframe and Adding New Variables\nStarting with the cardata data frame, we can now utilize one of the features of the packages to pipe the data.\nPiping means that the data ‘flows’ in the direction of the pipe. It’s actually called a pipeline of data.\nA bit of housekeeping. We want to convert the rownames in cardata to a variable.\nWe pipe the data frame and then use the function rownames_to_column() to do just that. We then pipe the data to rename the new variable rowname to car.\nWe can now use the mutate function to create a new variable or replace an existing variable.\nIn the following code, the data flow from cardata to the next line of code to create a new variable km_per_gallon using the mutate function.\nImagine a temporary data frame that consists of cardata with a new column for the km_per_gallon variable.\nEach new line of within the mutate} function creates a new variable. The second variable that we create converts kilometers per gallon to kilometers per liter or km_per_liter.\nYour temporary data frame now consists of the cardata data frame plus the two new variables.\nThe third line of the mutate statement creates a new variable that converts miles per gallon into kilometers per liter, essentially duplicating the process of the first two lines of the mutate statement. The new variable is called km2_per_liter.\nAt this point, you decide you only need to keep a subset of variables.\nWe pipe the resulting data frame to the select statement. The variables included in the select statement are kept in the temporary data frame while the variables excluded from the select statement are deleted from the temporary data frame.\nYou have now reached the end of the pipe. The “&lt;-” at the beginning then assigns all the data in the temporary data frame to the cardata2 data frame. Because we have used the grammar of piping, the original data frame is unchanged.\nThe grammar of piping is very useful as it allows you to manipulate a data frame without changing the contents of the original data frame.\nNote how we can start using some of the additional features in the kableExtra package to rename column names for improve presentation.\n\nrm(list = ls())\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ncardata &lt;- mtcars \n\ncardata2 &lt;- cardata %&gt;%\n  rownames_to_column() %&gt;%\n  rename(car           = rowname) %&gt;%\n  mutate(km_per_gallon = mpg*1.60934,\n         km_per_liter  = km_per_gallon*3.78541,\n         km2_per_liter = mpg*1.60934*3.78541) %&gt;%\n  select(car, mpg, cyl, wt, km_per_gallon, km_per_liter, km2_per_liter)\n\nkable(cardata[1:5,])\n\nkable(cardata2[1:5,],\n      col.names = c(\"Car\",\n                    \"MPG\",\n                    \"Cylinders\",\n                    \"Weight\",\n                    \"Kilometers per Gallon\",\n                    \"Kliometers per Liter\",\n                    \"Squared KM/Gallon\")) %&gt;%\nkable_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmpg\ncyl\ndisp\nhp\ndrat\nwt\nqsec\nvs\nam\ngear\ncarb\n\n\n\n\nMazda RX4\n21.0\n6\n160\n110\n3.90\n2.620\n16.46\n0\n1\n4\n4\n\n\nMazda RX4 Wag\n21.0\n6\n160\n110\n3.90\n2.875\n17.02\n0\n1\n4\n4\n\n\nDatsun 710\n22.8\n4\n108\n93\n3.85\n2.320\n18.61\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\nHornet 4 Drive\n21.4\n6\n258\n110\n3.08\n3.215\n19.44\n1\n0\n3\n1\n\n\nHornet Sportabout\n18.7\n8\n360\n175\n3.15\n3.440\n17.02\n0\n0\n3\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCar\n\n\nMPG\n\n\nCylinders\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nKilometers per Gallon\n\n\nKliometers per Liter\n\n\nSquared KM/Gallon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMazda RX4\n\n\n21.0\n\n\n6\n\n\n2.620\n\n\n33.79614\n\n\n127.9322\n\n\n127.9322\n\n\n\n\nMazda RX4 Wag\n\n\n21.0\n\n\n6\n\n\n2.875\n\n\n33.79614\n\n\n127.9322\n\n\n127.9322\n\n\n\n\nDatsun 710\n\n\n22.8\n\n\n4\n\n\n2.320\n\n\n36.69295\n\n\n138.8979\n\n\n138.8979\n\n\n\n\nHornet 4 Drive\n\n\n21.4\n\n\n6\n\n\n3.215\n\n\n34.43988\n\n\n130.3691\n\n\n130.3691\n\n\n\n\nHornet Sportabout\n\n\n18.7\n\n\n8\n\n\n3.440\n\n\n30.09466\n\n\n113.9206\n\n\n113.9206",

The result was two data frames, one for nominal GDP, and one for real GDP. It would be more efficient to make one API call that results in a single data frame with both variables.\nIn the following code, we combine the names of the two variables, that is, c(“GDP”,“GDPC1”) creates a row vector with the two names. This row vector is used by the tq_get function to make an API call to obtain the two variables from FRED.\nWhat’s important to note is that the all_gdp data fame is in long format. In other words, each row corresponds to one period of time for one variable.\nWe have to do some housecleaning.
