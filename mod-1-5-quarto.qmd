## What is Quarto?

**Quartro** is how we will work with R and RStudio to produce documents, assignments, and exams.

One way to think about Quarto is that it is like Microsoft Word, however, it is much more powerful and flexible.

In fact, the entire ECON 700 course is built with R, RStudio, and Quarto.

As with R and RStudio, the more you work with Quarto, the easier it comes to work with Quarto.

## Getting Started

-   First, ensure that you have [**R**](https://cloud.r-project.org/index.html) and [**RStudio**](https://posit.co/downloads/) installed correctly.

-   To install Quarto, go to [**Quarto**](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

-   Once you have installed Quarto, go to the getting started in the [**RStudio page**](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html).

-   The getting started page will help you understand the capabilities of Quarto.

## Creating a File

In RStudio, go to File -\> New File -\> New Quarto Document.

You will see the window below. Let's say we name our document: **Example-1**.

Once you have created this file, you will see the following window in RStudio:

## Code Chunks

R code chunks can be identified with **{r}**.

To start a code chunk, you use **\`\`\`{r}** and you close off the code chunk with **\`\`\`**.

You can run the code chunk interactively in RStudio, that is, you can click on the green arrow icon at the top of the code chunk and RStudio will display the results.

## Working with Quartro

We want to create a text description of in our new Quarto document. We also want to create a simple code chunk in our Quarto document that will execute when we **render** our file.

In your new file, let's write the following text:

This is an example Quarto file. You can write text here like a normal document.

And let's include the following code chunk:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

x <- 3
y <- 6
z <- 10

x*y
y*z
x/z

```

Your file should look like the following picture:

## Rendering

Use the **Render** button in RStudio to render the file and preview the output. If you prefer to automatically render whenever you save, check the **Render on Save** button in RStudio.

When you render, you can save your file as **Example1.qmd** and the rendered file should appear in a browser window.

Quarto is a powerful approach to displaying your work in R and RStudio.
