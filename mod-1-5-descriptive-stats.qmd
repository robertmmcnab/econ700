## Overview

Now that we have established a foundation of working with R and RStudio, we can use **descriptive statistics** to discuss the properties of population and sample data.

In this section, we will cover the following topics:

-   Frequency Distributions

-   Relative Frequency Distributions

-   Center, Spread, and Dispersion of Data

-   Mean, Median, and Mode

-   Trimmed and Weighted Means

-   Range, Variance, and Standard Deviation

-   Coefficient of Variation

-   Z-Scores

## Frequency Distributions

-   The **frequency** of a category, class, or value is the number of times it occurs in a data set.

-   A **frequency distribution** is summary of data.

-   A frequency distribution is the pattern of frequencies of variable of interest.

-   Given several **non-overlapping** categories or classes, a frequency distribution contains the number of observations per class or category.

-   A frequency distribution, to be complete, must be:

    -   **Mutually exclusive** - the classes or categories do not overlap.

    -   **Collectively exhaustive** - all the observations are described by the distribution

-   A frequency distribution may provide insights about the data that cannot be quickly obtained by examining the data itself.

## Frequency Example

For the following example, we use the **mtcars** data frame. 

First, we **group** the data by the cylinder variable. The **group_by** function notifies R that the data are organized by a specific variable or variables.

Here, we notify R that the cylinder variable is how the data are grouped together, that is, R should consider all the observations with 4 cylinders one group, all the observations with 6 cylinders one group, and all the observations with 8 cylinders one group.

Second, we create a new variable **freq_cyl** using the **summarize** function. The variable **freq_cyl** is equal to the number of observations in each group.

We then use the **arrange** function to sort the resulting frequencies from lowest number to the highest number.

We create a frequency table using the **kable** function.

```{webr-r}

rm(list = ls())

data("mtcars")

cyl_freq <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(freq_cyl = n()) %>%
  arrange(freq_cyl)

kable(cyl_freq,
      col.names = c("Cylinders", "Frequency"),
      align = c('c','c'),
      caption = 'Frequency Distribution of Cylinders') 
```

## Census Frequency

In the example below, we use the **censusapi** package to obtain data from the U.S. Census Bureau's *American Community Survey*. 

We use the API to download data on counties and county-equivalent geographies for the United States. We specify two variables, the name of each geography and the population of each geography.

We rename the census population variable, **B01001_001E**, to **total_pop**. 

We want to create categories for different ranges of population. To do this, we use the **case_when** function.

Having created the population categories, we **group_by** the population category variable and then use the **summarize** function to obtain a count of the number of observations in each category.

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Clear Memory 
rm(list = ls())

# Load Libraries

library(censusapi)
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
library(tidyverse)

#B01001_001E is total population
#Case When to Create Categories

county_pop <- getCensus(name = "acs/acs5",
            vintage = 2023,
            key = "9c1637a56ff93f0af6b4b1d0547ea048fe668175",
            vars = c("NAME",
                     "B01001_001E"),
            region = "county:*") %>%
rename(total_pop = B01001_001E) %>%
mutate(pop_cat = case_when(total_pop > 99999 ~ "Greater than 99,999",
                           total_pop > 49999 ~ "50,000 - 99,999",
                           total_pop > 24999 ~ "25,000 - 49,999",
                           total_pop > 9999  ~ "10,000 - 24,999",
                           TRUE ~ "0 - 9,999"))

# Summarize to Create Frequencies by Categories

county_freq <- county_pop %>%
  group_by(pop_cat) %>%
  summarize(freq_pop = n()) %>%
  arrange(pop_cat)

# Use frequency data frame to produce table

kable(county_freq,
      col.names = c("Category", "Frequency"),
      align = c('c','c'),
      caption = 'Frequency of County Population, 2023') %>%
kable_styling(font_size = 14)



```

## Frequency Distributions

- We can also graphically depict the frequency distribution.

- We can use **ggplot** to create a graphical plot of the frequency distribution.

- We have categories (population size) on the x-axis and the frequencies on the y-axis.


```{webr-r}

rm(list = ls())

data("mtcars")

cyl_freq <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(freq_cyl = n()) %>%
  arrange(freq_cyl)

ggplot(data = cyl_freq,
       aes(x    = cyl,
           y    = freq_cyl)) +
geom_col(fill = 'darkblue') +
labs(title    = 'Frequency Distribution for Cylinders',
     subtitle = 'MTCARS data',
     y        = 'Frequency',
     x        = 'Number of Cylinders')
```
