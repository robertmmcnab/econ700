## Unbiasedness

An estimator of a population parameter is **unbiased** if the expected
value of the estimator is equal to the value of the population
parameter.

More formally, the sample statistic $\hat{\theta}$ is an unbiased
estimator of the population parameter $\theta$ if:

$$E[\hat{\theta}] = \theta$$

In other words, an estimator is unbiased if it produces parameter
estimates that are, **on average**, equal to the population parameter.

An estimator that is not unbiased is a **biased** estimator.

The bias of an estimator is equal to its expected value minus the value
of the population parameter or:

$$
Bias(\hat{\theta}) = E[\hat{\theta}] - \theta
$$

In other words, an estimator is unbiased if its bias is equal to zero.

The sample average is an unbiased estimator of the population mean as:

$$
E[\bar{x}] = \mu
$$

It can be shown that the unadjusted sample variance is a biased
estimator of the population variance or:

$$
E[S_n^2] = E[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{1}^{n}(X_i - \bar{X})^2] = \frac{n-1}{n}\sigma^2
$$

It can also be shown that the adjusted sample variance is an unbiased
estimator of the population variance or:

$$
E[s^2] = E[\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_1^n(X_i - \bar{X})^2 ] = \sigma^2
$$

Why? When the population mean is unknown, we must estimate it with the
sample average. We lose a **degree of freedom** as we employ an estimate
instead of a parameter. The number of degrees of freedom is equal to the
number of sample observations minus the number of parameters to be
estimated.

## Efficiency

An **efficient estimator** has the smallest possible variance among all
unbiased estimators.

More formally, the sample statistic $\hat{\theta}$ is relatively
efficient to $\hat{\hat{\theta}}$ when

$$var(\hat{\theta}) < var(\hat{\hat{\theta}})$$

## Consistency

An estimator of a population parameter is **consistent** if it converges
in probability to the true value of the parameter as the sample size
tends to infinity.

The sample statistic $\hat{\theta}$ is consistent when

$$plim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \, \hat{\theta} \rightarrow \theta$$

It can be shown, for example, that the sample mean converges almost
surely to the mean, which implies that the sample mean converges in
probability to the mean or:

$$
plim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \, \bar{X} \rightarrow \mu
$$

While the unadjusted variance estimator is biased and the adjusted
variance estimator is unbiased, it can be shown that both estimators are
consistent estimators of the population variance.

$$
plim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \, S^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{1}^{n}(X_i - \bar{X})^2] \rightarrow \sigma^2
$$ $$
plim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \, s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{1}^{n}(X_i - \bar{X})^2] \rightarrow \sigma^2
$$

## Law of Large Numbers

The **large of large numbers** states that the average of an experiment
will converge to the expected value as more trials of the experiment are
performed.

Let $\bar{x_n}$ be the sample average across $n$ trials.

Let $E[x] = \mu$.

The law of large numbers states that the sample average converges in
probability towards the expected value or:

$$\bar{x_n} \rightarrow^P \mu$$

$$lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} P(|\bar{x}_n - \mu| < \epsilon) = 1, \quad \epsilon >0 $$

The strong law of large numbers states that the sample average converges
almost surely to the expected value or:

$$\bar{x} \rightarrow^{a.s} \mu$$

$$lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \, P(\bar{x}_n = \mu) = 1$$

## Uniform Example of LLN

We can demonstrate the large of large numbers of a uniform distribution.

The expected value of a uniform distribution is

$$E[x] = (a + b) / 2$$

Given $a = 1$ and $b = 10$ then

$$E[x] = (1 + 10)/2 = 5.5$$

The code below does the following

-   Constructs a population of 100,000 random observations from a
    uniform distribution

-   Establishes two vectors, one for the number of trials, one for the
    sample averages

-   Performs a loop

-   Inside the loop, the trial number is equal to the loop counter

-   Takes a sample of size *i* and estimates the sample average

-   Places the vectors of trial numbers and averages in a tibble

-   Constructs a plot

As the sample size increases, the sample averages tend toward the
population mean.

```{r, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}

rm(list = ls())

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(kableExtra)

population <- runif(100000, min = 1, max = 10)

ntrials = 10000
trials <- rep(0,ntrials)
avgs <- rep(0,ntrials)

for(i in 1:ntrials){
  trials[i] <- i
  avgs[i] <- mean(sample(population, i, replace = FALSE))
}

mean_frame <- tibble(trials,avgs)

ggplot(mean_frame,
       aes(x = trials,
       y = avgs)) +
geom_point() +
theme_minimal() +
labs(title = "Large of Large Numbers Simulation",
     subtitle = "Population of 100,000",
     y     = "Sample Average",
     x     = "Trial Number")
```

## Normal Example of LLN

We can demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers using data drawn from a
normal distribution.

We know the sample average is equal to:

$$
\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i
$$

We also know that the sample average estimator is unbiased and
consistent:

$$
E[\bar{X}] = \mu
$$

$$
plim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \, \bar{X} \rightarrow \mu
$$

We use the code chunk from the last example as a starting point. Here we
modify the population so that it is drawn from a normal distribution and
we also create a table to illustrate the differences between the first
five observations and the last five observations.

```{r, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}

rm(list = ls())

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(kableExtra)

population <- rnorm(100000, mean = 25, sd = 10)

ntrials = 10000
trials <- rep(0,ntrials)
avgs <- rep(0,ntrials)

for(i in 1:ntrials){
  trials[i] <- i
  avgs[i] <- mean(sample(population, i, replace = FALSE))
}

mean_frame <- tibble(trials,avgs)

mean_frame_2 <- mean_frame %>%
  filter(trials <= 5 | trials > ntrials - 5)

ggplot(mean_frame,
       aes(x = trials,
       y = avgs)) +
geom_point() +
theme_minimal() +
labs(title = "Large of Large Numbers Simulation",
     subtitle = "Population of 100,000",
     y     = "Sample Average",
     x     = "Trial Number")

kable(mean_frame_2,
      align  = 'c',
      digits = 3,
      col.names = c('Obsveration','Sample average')) %>%
kable_styling()


```

## Central Limit Theorem

The central limit theorem states that when independent random variables
are summed, that, in many situations, the normalized sum tends toward a
normal distribution even if the original variables were not normally
distributed.

Let $\{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ be a random sample of size $n$.

Let $\{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ be a sequence identically and
independently distributed random variables.

Let $\{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ have mean $\mu$ and finite variance
$\sigma^2$.

$$E[x_1] = E[x_2] = \dots = E[x_n] = \mu$$

$$var(x_1) = var(x_2) = \dots = var(x_n) = \sigma^2$$

Thus, by the law of large numbers, the sample average of these random
variables converges almost surely (and in probability) to the expected
value $\mu$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.

## Central Limit Theorem

Suppose $\{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ is a sequence of i.i.d. random
variables with $E[x_i] = \mu$ and $var[x_i] = \sigma^2$. Then, as $n$
approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n} \, (\bar{x} - \mu)$
converge in distribution to normal $N \sim (0, \sigma^2)$.

$$lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \, \sqrt{n}( \bar{x} - \mu) \rightarrow^d N(0,\sigma^2)$$

If $\sigma >0$, converge in distribution means that the cumulative
distribution functions of $\sqrt{n} \, (\bar{x} - \mu)$ converge
pointwise to the CDF of $N(0,\sigma^2)$ for every real number $z$.

Therefore, it can be shown the sample average $\bar{x}$ is such that

$$lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \, \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\sigma}( \bar{x} - \mu) \rightarrow^d N(0,1)$$

In other words, if a random sample of size $n$ is selected from any
population with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, then when
$n$ is sufficiently large

$$\bar{x} \sim N(\mu, \sigma/\sqrt{n})$$

## Sampling Distributions

The sampling distribution of the sample average estimator is the
probability distribution of all possible values of the sample average
estimator.

Recall that a collection of random variables is identically and
identically distributed if each random variable has the same probability
distribution as the others and all are mutually independent.

First, assume that the random variables are identically and identically
distributed or:

$$
x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \sim i.i.d
$$

***Note that we have not assumed the underlying distribution, merely
that the distribution of each random variable is the same.***

Second, assume that the mean and variance of each random variable is:

$$
\mu_i, \quad \sigma_i^2 \quad \forall i
$$

Third, the expected value of the sample averages is:

$$E(\bar{x}) = E(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i) = \frac{1}{n} \, E(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i) = \frac{1}{n} \, \sum_{i=1}^n E(x_i)$$

Given that $x_i$ are i.i.d. with mean $\mu_x$, then:

$$E(\bar{x}) =  \frac{1}{n} \, \sum_{i=1}^n E(x_i) =  \frac{1}{n} \, \sum_{i=1}^n \mu_x = \frac{1}{n} \times n \times \mu_x = \mu_x$$

The variance of the sample averages is:

$$var(\bar{x}) = var(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i)$$

$$var(\bar{x}) = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \, var(x_i) + \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j = 1}^{n} cov(x_i, x_j) \quad \forall i \ne j$$

Since the covariance between any dissimilar random variables is assumed
to be zero, the variance of the sample averages is:

$$var(\bar{x}) = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \, var(x_i) = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \, \sigma_x^2 = \frac{1}{n^2} \times n \times \sigma_x^2 = \frac{\sigma_x^2}{n}$$The
variance of the sample average estimator is decreasing in the number of
observations.

**In other words, as the number of observations in repeated sampling
increases, the variance of the distribution of the sample average
estimator declines relatively to distributions with smaller sample
sizes.**.

## CLT Example

In the following code below, we demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and
the Central Limit Theorem.

We would expect that, given repeated sampling, that the sample average
estimates would be, on average equal to the population mean.

We would also expect that, given repeated sampling, that as sample size
increased, the variance of the distribution of sample average estimates
would decrease.

***We observe that as sample size increases, the variance of the
distribution of the sample average estimates declines. Each of the
distributions is centered at the population mean.***

The code completes the following tasks:

-   The population of 100,000 observations is drawn from a standard
    normal distribution

-   Sample sizes are equal to 1, 10, 100, and 1000

-   The number of repetitions is 1,000

-   In other words, we will take 1,000 samples of size 1, then 1,000
    samples of size 10 and so on

-   We can two lists in which we can populate data

-   We have two loops. The outer loop loops over sample sizes. The inner
    loop over repetitions.

-   In the inner loop, the sample size is set by the outer loop index
    (1, 10, 100, 1000)

-   The sample average is estimated

-   The sample size is assigned

-   A data frame is created containing sample average and sample size

-   The data frame is put into a list indexed by the inner loop counter

-   After the inner loop completes, all the data frames are put in a
    loop indexed by the outer loop

-   After the outer loop completes, all the data frames are row bound

-   The plot illustrates the measure of central tendency and variance of
    each distribution
