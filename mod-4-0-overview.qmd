## Introduction

Welcome to **Module 4** of ECON 700.

This module introduces the foundational concepts of probability as a measure of uncertainty and likelihood. Students learn how random experiments generate outcomes that form a sample space, and how probability quantifies the chance that specific outcomes occur. The module progresses through the building blocks of probability theory, including combinations, permutations, complements, unions, and intersections of events. Through these principles, students develop an understanding of mutually exclusive and independent events and how they shape probability calculations.

The second half of the module applies probability rules to real-world decision-making and data analysis. Learners explore conditional probability, the multiplication and addition laws, and the distinction between joint and marginal probabilities. The module culminates in an introduction to Bayes’ Theorem, illustrating how prior beliefs are updated with new evidence—first conceptually, then through applications like medical testing and the Monty Hall problem. This approach emphasizes the interpretive and practical power of probability in economic reasoning, uncertainty, and risk assessment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

-   MLO 1: **Define** key probability concepts, including experiments, sample spaces, and events.

-   MLO 2: **Compute** probabilities using basic rules (addition, multiplication, complement) for mutually exclusive and independent events.

-   MLO 3: **Differentiate** between permutations and combinations in counting possible outcomes.

-   MLO 4: **Interpret** conditional probabilities and construct joint and marginal probability tables.

-   MLO 5: **Apply** Bayes’ Theorem to update probabilities based on new information.

-   MLO 6: **Analyze** probabilities using R.
