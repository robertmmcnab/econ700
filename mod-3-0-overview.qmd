## Introduction

Welcome to **Module 3** of ECON 700.

This module introduces students to bivariate data analysis through the concepts of covariance and correlation. Building on prior discussions of univariate statistics, it explores how two variables move together and the extent to which their relationship can be quantified. Covariance is presented as a measure of joint variability that indicates whether two variables tend to increase or decrease together. Students learn that while the sign of covariance conveys direction (positive or negative association), its magnitude is difficult to interpret due to dependence on the units of measurement.

To overcome this limitation, the module introduces the Pearson correlation coefficient—a standardized, unitless measure that captures the strength and direction of linear relationships between two variables. Through practical examples using R and real-world data such as mtcars and World Bank indicators, students compute, interpret, and compare covariance and correlation values. The module concludes by emphasizing that correlation measures association, not causation, and that careful interpretation is required when evaluating statistical relationships.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

-   MLO 1: **Define** covariance and correlation as measures of association.

-   MLO 2: **Compute** sample and population covariance and correlation using R.

-   MLO 3: **Interpret** the sign and magnitude of covariance and correlation coefficients.

-   MLO 4: **Explain** how changes in units of measurement affect covariance but not correlation.

-   MLO 5: **Distinguish** between statistical association and causal relationships in bivariate data.

-   MLO 6: **Apply** covariance and correlation measures using R.
